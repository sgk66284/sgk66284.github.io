	<h3> The Bavarian "Motorrad" maker BMW has in many ways stagnated over the years, largely being solely known for its cars and adventure touring motocycle, the R1200GS.
		But all this changed with the introduction of the R nineT model line, encompassing all of the facets of the modern "sport-heritige" craze with a scrambler, cafe racer, retro dual sport, and a stripped back 'pure' model lacking some of the other models' farkels in exchange for a lower MSRP.
		This latest addition is powered by the company's legendary 1170 cc air coled boxer engine. 
		Along with the brand's ever excellend quality, this new release has made for an excellent product with which buyers can ride comfortably and with peace of mind. </h3>
