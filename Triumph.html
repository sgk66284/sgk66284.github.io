	<h3> To most, when they hear that Triumph is a British motorbike brand they shrink away and lose interest as the British have never been known for having quality in their past automotive offerings.
		But Triumph is exactly their name-sake.
		They are a "triumph" over that long held prejudice; producing very reliable, drop-dead gorgeous bikes.
		Their msot well known model line would be the Bonneville and it spurs one to think of old UJM standard bikes that are a far cry fro mthe highly specialized market that we now find ourselves in.
		If one thing could be said about Triumph its that they have style in spades thoughout the breadth of their catalogue.</h3>
